## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Basic program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. The program was made just for fun and to practice my C++

## 💿 Working Principle <a name = "built_using"></a>

- Program greets a user
- Program asks to input a measurement unit the user uses
- Based on the inputed value, program determines the function it will use
  - program asks to input the current temperature outside
  - if the user uses Celsius, program will convert his temperature to Fahrenheit
  - if the user uses Fahrenheit, program will convert his temperature to Celsius
  - if the user inputed an incorrect value, program will end
- Program outputs user's temperature converted to corresponding measurement system
